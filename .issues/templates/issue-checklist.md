# Issue Creation Checklist

Before creating a new issue, complete this checklist:

## 🔍 Existing Issue Check
- [ ] Ran `just issues` to see all current issues
- [ ] Used `just search-issues <keyword>` to search for similar topics
- [ ] Checked `just issues-summary` for quick overview
- [ ] Reviewed existing issues for similar functionality/components
- [ ] Confirmed this is not a duplicate or subset of existing work

## 📝 Issue Planning
- [ ] Determined this needs a new issue (vs. commenting on existing)
- [ ] Identified the appropriate scope (not too broad/narrow)
- [ ] Considered if this should be broken into multiple issues
- [ ] Planned how this relates to existing issues/roadmap

## 🎯 Issue Content
- [ ] Used appropriate template from `.issues/templates/`
- [ ] Included clear summary and background
- [ ] Defined specific, testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Outlined technical approach
- [ ] Identified related components and files
- [ ] Set realistic effort estimates

## 🚀 Ready to Create
- [ ] Drafted issue locally with `just draft-issue <name>`
- [ ] Reviewed draft for completeness and clarity
- [ ] Ready to create with `just create-issue "<title>" <draft>`

**Remember**: Collaboration over duplication! When in doubt, comment on existing issues first.
